"""The interactive tutor — the deliverable a student would actually use.

Deliberately built on the same parts as the benchmark: the same course config,
the same system prompt, the same retriever, the same model clients. A demo that
reimplemented any of those would be a different system from the one the report
has numbers for, and the numbers would no longer describe the thing being shown.
So `ym07 chat` with a corpus is condition C2; without one it is C1.

Two things the batch harness does not need, and this does:

- **Memory.** Tutoring is a conversation — the scaffolding policy asks the
  student what they have tried, which is worthless if the reply is not
  remembered. History is folded into the user message by the shared
  `user_prompt`, so it travels through the unmodified client interface.
- **Visible cost.** Every turn on the hosted arm spends money. The running total
  is printed so it is never a surprise, and so the difference between the hosted
  and local arms is felt rather than merely reported.
